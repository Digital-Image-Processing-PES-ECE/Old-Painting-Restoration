1. MATLAB Core Functions:
   Image Processing Toolbox: 
     - Essential for basic image manipulation and processing tasks, such as reading, displaying, and converting images.
     - Key functions: imread, imshow, rgb2gray, imadjust, stretchlim, inpaintCoherent, imsharpen, fspecial, deconvlucy, rgb2lab, lab2rgb, etc.

2. MATLAB Toolboxes:
   Image Processing Toolbox:
       - Image transformation and filtering (e.g., imadjust, stretchlim, imsharpen)
       - Image enhancement and restoration (e.g., inpaintCoherent, deconvlucy)
       - Thresholding and Masking (e.g., binary masks, rgb2gray, fspecial for Gaussian filters)
   Computer Vision Toolbox:
     - This toolbox can be used for advanced image inpainting algorithms (e.g., inpaintCoherent) and image registration tasks.
   Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox:
     - This may be used if you are analyzing or evaluating metrics like contrast change or mean brightness change using statistical functions.

3. System Requirements:
   - MATLAB Version: Preferably MATLAB R2020b or later (but earlier versions should work as well).
   - Operating System: Windows, MacOS, or Linux with appropriate MATLAB versions.

4. Hardware Requirements:
   - RAM: At least 4 GB for processing images efficiently.
   - Disk Space: Sufficient space to store image datasets and output images.

5. Other Software:
   - Image Files: JPEG, PNG, or other image formats for input and output.
